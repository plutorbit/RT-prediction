# RT-prediction 
### Introduction to Mass Spectrometry @ TUM 

Our team of four participants took on the task to build a model in order to predict retention time of sequences. 

First of all, by analysing the data with the help of statistical methods to figure out its distribution as well as a fitting normalization function. We were able to create a clean dataset with unique datapoints in order to produce the best results for machine learning. 

The code resembles the approach in our paper on retention time prediction "Safari through Machine Leearning - Retention Time Prediciton" written for the seminar Problem Based Learning.
