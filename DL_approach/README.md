# RNN model with TensorFlow/Keras

The file _'RNN_model.py'_ contains code for a **Functional API model**, which we first used to
train on multiple input features without noticing that normally in DL features should be extracted
by the model itself from sequence data only.

The file _'RNN_sequential_model.py'_ contains code for a **Sequential model**, which trains only on sequences
and their retention times.
